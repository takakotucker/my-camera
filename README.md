This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Idea behind

- NextJS
- GraphQL for API served on localhost
- GraphQL client fetch data, pass it in props

## Need to complete

- Fix errors (Unfortunately errors need resolving)
- Add logics/functions to inject data into relevant table
- Add Map
- Unit tests
- CLI
- TypeScript
